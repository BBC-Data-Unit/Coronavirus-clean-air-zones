# Coronavirus delays cleaner air plans in cities

In March 2020 the England Data Unit and the Shared Data Unit worked with the Local Democracy Reporting Service to [report](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52035655) on delays to plans to reduce high-polluting vehicles travelling around UK cities due to the coronavirus crisis.

We looked at air pollution data and found that levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) had fallen since people were told to work from home the previous week.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
